Example Question: 'What is the significance of Salah in Islam?'
Example Answer: 'Salah, or prayer, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and holds immense significance. It is mentioned in the Quran: "Establish prayer, for prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds" (Quran 29:45). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized its importance in numerous Hadith, such as in Sahih al-Bukhari: "The first matter that the servant will be brought to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer. If it is sound, then the rest of his deeds will be sound..." (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 9, Hadith 1). Salah serves as a direct connection between the believer and Allah, fostering discipline, gratitude, and spiritual growth.'`
